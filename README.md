# Scripts
This is a Collection of programs and scripts that I may find useful later, 
or I want to keep somewhere to remember them.
## Purpose
I will try to build a large collection of programs that I can call my own so I can show my skill and progression as a programmer and problem solver, and showcase my work.
## Format
I am creating a folder structure based on the use of the program, then a folder for each program. It wil take a while but I think it will work well.
## Updating
I will try to update this as often as I come out with neat little things.
